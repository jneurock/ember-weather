# Ember Weather

This is a tiny [Ember](http://emberjs.com) app that displays weather conditions from locations around the world. It's just a little demo application and isn't a project open to collaboration.

## Demo

### Things that could be better

* Don't hard-code the list of countries
* Don't hard-code the weather adapter
* There's surely a better way to handle weather conditions adapter errors
* Models would expire since they are time-sensitive
* Animated transitions
* ARIA attributes
* More browser testing
* Some acceptance testing
* More thorough tests
* Better parsing of location names
* Displaying a map instead of cards?
